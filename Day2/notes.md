#Variable and Data types

Variable:
A variable is used to store data. In python, we do not need to declare the type before using it.
Example:
name = "Dharshini"
age = 19

Common Basic data types:
-> int - whole numbers (0,1,2,....)
-> float - decimal numbers (1.5,2.5,........)
-> str - text ("Hello")
-> bool - True or False)

type() :
tpe() is a function used to check the data type of a variable.
Example:
x=10
print(type(x))
Output: <class 'int'>

Rules for variable names:
-> Must start with a letter or underscore.
-> Cannot start with a number.
-> No spaces allowed.
-> Use meaningful names.

Today I learned how to store data in variables and understood basic Python data types.
