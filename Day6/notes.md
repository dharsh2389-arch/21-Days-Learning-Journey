#Loops in Python

What is a Loop?
A loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
Python supports:
->for loop
->while loop

1. for Loop
Used when we know how many times to repeat.
Syntax:
for variable in range(start, stop, step):
    statement
Example:
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

2. range() Function
range(1, 6) → 1 to 5
range(0, 10, 2) → 0,2,4,6,8

3. while Loop
Used when repetition depends on a condition.
Syntax:
while condition:
    statement

Today, I have learned the concept of looping in python and I have solved two problems: Mini Banking Transaction System, Inventory Stock  Monitoring System using loop.
