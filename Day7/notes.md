#Strings in Python

What is a String?
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in:
- Single quotes ''
- Double quotes ""
Example:
name = "Dharshini"

String Indexing:
Each character has an index.
Example:
word = "Python"
P  y  t  h  o  n
0  1  2  3  4  5
print(word[0])  → P

Negative Indexing
 P  y  t  h  o  n
-6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
print(word[-1]) → n

String Slicing
Syntax:
string[start:end]
Example:
word[0:4] → Pyth

Common String Functions
len(string)
upper()
lower()
strip()
replace()
count()
find()

Today, I have learned the concept of Strings in python and solved some problems: Email validator and Password strength checker.
