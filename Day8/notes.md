#Lists in Python

What is a List?
A list is a collection of multiple values stored in a single variable.
Example:
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

Lists:
- Are ordered
- Are mutable (can be changed)
- Can store different data types

Accessing Elements (Indexing):
numbers = [10,20,30]
numbers[0] → 10
numbers[1] → 20
numbers[-1] → 30

List Slicing:
numbers[0:2] → [10, 20]

Common List Methods:
append()   → Add element
insert()   → Insert at position
remove()   → Remove element
pop()      → Remove by index
len()      → Length of list
max()      → Maximum value
min()      → Minimum value
sum()      → Sum of elements

Today, I have learned the concepts of lists and common list methods in python. I have solved two problems: 1. Student Mark Analyzer, 2. Shopping Cart System.
