Tuples & Sets
1. Tuple:
A tuple is a collection of values that is:
- Ordered
- Immutable (cannot be changed)
- Allows duplicate values
Example:
numbers = (10, 20, 30)
Accessing:
numbers[0] → 10
Tuple methods:
count()
index()
Tuples are used when data should not be modified.

2. Set:
A set is a collection of:
- Unordered values
- Unique elements only
- No duplicate values allowed
Example:
numbers = {10, 20, 30}
If duplicates exist:
{10, 20, 20, 30}
Result → {10, 20, 30}
Set methods:
add()
remove()
union()
intersection()
difference()
Sets are used when uniqueness is required.

Difference Between Tuple and Set:

Tuple:
- Ordered
- Immutable
- Allows duplicates

Set:
- Unordered
- Mutable
- No duplicates.

Today, I have learned the concept of Tuple and Sets in python. I have practiced some problems using tuples and sets and also solved College Course Enrollment System.
